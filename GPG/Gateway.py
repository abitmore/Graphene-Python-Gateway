Graphene Python Gateway

Built in collaboration with bitshares.org


This is the primary script to be launched by the gateway admin, in terminal:

    python3 Gateway.py

Launches 3 concurrent run forever processes:

WITHDRAWAL  client side transfer operation listener for the Bitshares blockchain
DEPOSIT     falcon api server providing rotating foreign chain deposit addresses
RECYCLE     moves all incoming funds to outgoing account

Currently serving from bitshares to eosio and ripple
